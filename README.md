# Blackout
At the click of a button, covers the monitors with a black form that can be closed easily.
Each form is a solid black colour and completely fills the monitor from the top-left point to span over the width and height to the bottom-right point.
The close button appears in the very top-right most corner on each monitor.
Each close button you click will remove the blackout form from that specific monitor.
